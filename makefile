# Pick a platform below.  X11 for Linux/Mac/Unix, and WIN32 for windows.
# In either X11 or WIN32, Postscript is also simultaneously available.
# You can also pick NO_GRAPHICS, which will allow your code to compile without
# change on any platform, but no graphics will display (all calls are stubbed
# out).
 
# Compiling to support X11 requires the X11 development libraries, Xft and fontconfig.
#
# Ubuntu:
# `sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxft-dev libfontconfig1-dev` to install.
#
# Other Linux:
# If you are using some other Linux distribution, search the internet for how to install those libraries.
# They are almost certainly available in your package manager.
#
# Macs:
# Please note that a Mac can run the X11 graphics if the X11 compatibility layer, XQuartz, is installed.
# And homebrew, a package manager, is probably your best bet for installing the development libraries.
# Finally note that Macs will probably also need pkg-config, unless you would like to specify the path
# to the freetype headers manually.
