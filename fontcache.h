/**
 * Maximum sizes for the font cache. The "ZEROS" one is for fonts of zero rotation, and
 * the "ROTATED" one is for fonts with other rotation. If you plan on rotating text to
 * many rotations, say random ones, and displaying them all at the same time, I suggest
 * something large for "ROTATED". The value of "ZEROS" is probably fine.
 *
 * What these values really mean to you is: because the text drawing is really lazy about
 * loading fonts, the "ZEROS" should be at least how many font sizes you expect to be visible
 * at a given time, and the "ROTATED" is for how many other different angle-fontsize combinations
 * you expect to be visible at a given time. If you program remains within these limits, there
 * will be no slow frames, except the first one where you change many visible combinations.
 * For after this frame, the font cache has filled up with the fonts that are visible
 *
 * A quick experiment gave these results:
 *    10 fonts =>     540 KiB
 *   100 fonts =>   1.7   MiB
 *  1000 fonts =>  13.5   Mib
 * 10000 fonts => 132.4   Mib

/**
 * This is a class that caches fonts. It separates out unrotated and rotated fonts,
 * for the reason that the unrotated ones are used for bounds estimation anyway, as
 * well as that they are generally convenient to have around. For each group, it uses
 * a queue to keep track of the order of creation, and when a new font would put a
 * cache over capacity, it deletes the oldest one first. The maps are to allow fast
 * lookup of fonts from their size and rotation.
 *
 * This cache is also not very complicated, and it could be, if there were a good reason.
 *
 * Also note that no references retrieved from this cache should be retained, as
 * another part of the program may cause the creation of another font(s) that will
 * push yours out. Instead a font should be retrieved every time it is needed.
 * 
 * We're currently using only integer font rotations (in degrees), to avoid having
 * a tremendous number of possible font rotations.
