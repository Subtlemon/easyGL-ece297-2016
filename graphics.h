/* 
 * These functions all draw UTF-8 text within some sort of bounding box;

 * interfaces so you can choose whichever one is most convenient.
 * 
 * The text is drawn centered around the point (xc,yc), text_center, or
 * in the case of drawtext_in, the centre of the bbox parameter.
 *
 * - SPECIFIC PAREMETER SPECIFICATION:
 * 
 * If text won't fit in bounds specified, the text isn't drawn.
 * This is useful for avoiding text going everywhere at high zoom levels.
 * 
 * boundx and boundy specify a width and height bound, respectively, whereas
 * bounds and bbox specify a box in which the text completely fit, or it won't
 * be drawn
 *
 * If you would like to have these functions ignore a particular bound,
 * specify a huge value. I recommend FLT_MAX or std::numeric_limits<float>::max(),
 * from <cfloat> and <limits> respectively.
 *
 * tolerance, effectively, makes the given bounding box bigger, on
 * all sides by that amount.
 * 
 * For debugging purposes, if you would like to see exactly where the
 * bounds of the text are and the center of the text define SHOW_TEXT_BBOX 
 * in your build, or uncomment it in drawtext(..) in graphics.c .
 *
 * - NOTES:
 * Finally, it should be noted that bounding is done based on the dimensions of
 * the final bounding rectangle of the actual rendered text, so the content _will_
 * affect the height (and/or width with rotated text), therefore affecting the bounds.
 * If you would like to hide text based on zoomlevel and fontsize directly, use
 * the Level Of Detail functions for this.
 *
 * As said before, these functions take UTF-8 encoded strings, so if you would like
 * to use non-ASCII characters, make sure your font supports them. Also, note that
 * those characters probably won't show up in postscript output, as postscript doesn't
 * understand UTF-8. They will be present in the file, but won't be displayed.
 *
 * Oh, and one more thing, if you would like aligned baselines, see the large comment
 * in drawtext(..) in graphics.c .
